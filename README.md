# Vacation Tracking System (VTS)

The **Vacation Tracking System** is based on concepts presented in the textbook **The Object-Oriented Analysis and Design**, 3rd Edition. This project focuses on designing the system's workflow and defining its use cases in detail.

Iâ€™ve created comprehensive **Flow Diagrams**, **Sequence Diagrams**, **Pseudo Code** and **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)** to capture the systemâ€™s architecture and functionality.

### ðŸ“„ **Documentation**

For detailed information about the system, including architecture, use cases, and implementation details, please refer to the [**Documentation**](./docs/documentation.md).
